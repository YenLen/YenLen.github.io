	    	<p>How to stand out from the existing point apps?</p>
	    	What's the difference between Point Tree and other point apps?<br>
	    	<span>To stores:</span><br>
	    	Point Tree requires only a iPad for each store; however, most point service needs not only a iPad device, but also a stamp-like device to scan the iPad.<br>
	    	Point Tree also provide a "promotion game" in the app.<br>
	    	<span>To customers:</span><br>
	    	Point Tree allows customers give their own points to their friends. It is hard to collect points alone, but Point Tree users collect points together.

	    	<p>Challenges : retain users</p>
	    		In the original PointTree apps, only when users wants to redeem the reward points, they will open the app.
	    		We tend to retain users and attract them to open the app. Therefore, we create Mascots. As long as user receives one point, the Mascots will grow up.<br>
	    		<span>User Story：</span>
	    		When users receive a notification on their mobile device, they will open the app to see "what's the next level of Mascot".

	    	<p>Discover：problem with store app interface</p>
	    		A boba tea owner reported us that some customers couldn't enter their phone number in the first place. Thus, we went to the boba tea store and sit inside the store to see users' action.<br> Our store app automatically input "09", so users only need to enter the rest numbers. However, we found that common people enter their phone numbers with all numbers, like "09xx-xxx-xxx". Thus, error occurs whenever they do not notice "09" which has already input.<br> 
	    	<span>Result：</span>
	    		Now, if users enter the full 10 numbers, the first two numbers "09" will be ignored automatically.<br>
	    		At first, we want to delete "09". However, "09" tells users " You need to enter <span>mobile phone number</span>"
