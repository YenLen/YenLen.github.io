	    	I co-founded a startup as a product designer to build a digital reward point system, PointTree, with the aim of connecting businesses with customers.<br><br><br>
	    	
	    	<span>What to solve?</span><br>
	    	In Taiwan, many stores provide reward cards for customers. As long as customers reach certain amount of reward points, they can redeem the reward points for certain products.
			Our goal is to reduce physical reward cards that can help to reduce paper waste and also connect businesses with customers in digital ways.

	    	<span>To stores</span><br>
	    	PointTree requires only an iPad for each store, and customers can receive points by entering their mobile phone numbers.<br>
			After entering mobile phone numbers, the system will automatically send a registration message to the customer, and guide them to register via customer app.<br>
	    	PointTree also provide a "promotion game" in the app.<br><br>
	    	<span>To customers</span><br>
	    	PointTree allows customers to send their own points to their friends.<br>
			It is hard to collect points alone, but PointTree users collect points together.

	    	<span style="color: black;font-size: 22px">Challenges : retain users</span><br><br>
	    	In the original PointTree apps, only when users wants to redeem the reward points, they will open the app.
	    	We tend to retain users and attract them to open the app more regularly. Hence, we create Mascots. As long as the user receives one point, the Mascots will level up and grow into different appearance.<br><br>
	    	<span>User Story</span><br>
	    	When users receive a notification on their mobile device, they will open the app to see "what's the next level of Mascot".

	    	<span style="color: black;font-size: 22px">Discovery：store app UI problem</span><br><br>
	    
	    		Since Taiwan mobile phone numbers always begin with 09 followed by 8 digits, we prefilled the first two numbers by default with the aim of providing convenience and guiding users what to enter. However, after we observed users’ behavior when they dealt with this system, we found out that users preferred to enter full serial numbers because they were more acquainted to memorize all numbers by heart in some scenarios. Consequently, we redesigned the user interface and added a placeholder text showed by default to prevent erroneous actions.
